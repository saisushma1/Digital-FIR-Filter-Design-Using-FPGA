# Digital-FIR-Filter-Design-Using-FPGA
This project implements a reconfigurable FIR filter on FPGA using Verilog. Filter coefficients are updated dynamically via UART without reprogramming the FPGA. The design is validated by comparing FPGA output with a Python reference model, demonstrating accurate real-time signal filtering performance.
